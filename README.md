# Ruby on Rails Tutorial

## hello_app

This is the first application for the [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://railstutorial.jp/)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/). Hello, world!

### Tips I lerned from this app

- Send request to //localhost:3000 with HTTP, not HTTPS.
- `heroku git:remote -a` to `git push heroku master`.
  - Confirm it by `git remote -v`
- Put your rails project on the root of your repository, or you will have problem when deployment.
